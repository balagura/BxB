\title{B*B, beam-beam simulation for vdM scans at LHC}
\description{
"beam_beam" function simulates bunch particles in an
             accelerator influenced by the electromagnetic force of
             another bunch ("beam-beam" effect). Reports corrections
             to the bunches overlap integral. See "?beam_beam" for details.
