\title{\code{kicked} convenience function}
\usage{
kicked(momentum, Z, ip, beta, next_phase_over_2pi, exact_phases = FALSE,
  gaussian)
}
\arguments{
\item{momentum}{In GeV.}

\item{Z}{Charge of the particles in the units of the proton charge.}

\item{ip}{Interaction point (IP) number (counting from zero) for which the
Gaussian sigmas are specified. Kicked bunch sigmas at other IP2 are
calculated via beta-function as sigma(ip) * sqrt(beta(ip) /
beta(IP2)). Note, that contrary to that, the kicker sigmas should be
specified directly at the IP of the beam-beam interaction, without any
extrapolation via beta. In other words, such kicker sigmas, in general,
can differ from the ones at this kicked "ip".}

\item{beta}{List with "x" and "y" components each specifying a vector of
the corresponding beta-function values (beta-star) at all simulated
interaction points, in meters.}

\item{next_phase_over_2pi}{List with "x" and "y" components specifying
transverse betatron oscillation phases divided by 2pi. The phase at
IP=0 is zero by definition, therefore, the "x" and "y" vectors should
start from the phase at IP=1, this is why this parameter is called
"next" phase over 2pi. The order of IPs = 0,1,2, ... is determined by
the order in which the kicked bunch collides with the kickers in the
accelerator, so, eg. it is opposite for two beams rotating in the
opposite directions. The lengths of "x" and "y" vectors should be equal
to the total number of simulated IPs. The last value in the array is
the tune.}

\item{exact_phases}{If values in \code{next_phase_over_2pi} are given with
2 (3) digits after the comma, after 100 (1000) turns the points return
almost to their original positions if the beam-beam effect is small (as
100* or 1000 * phases/2pi become integer). The simulation, therefore,
probes the same part of the phase space over and over again, and extra
turns almost do not improve the convergence. To avoid this and to add
extra randomness in the transverse particle trajectories, "negligible"
irrational numbers randomly distributed in the interval
-exp(-8.5)...+exp(-8.5) = +/-0.0001017342 are added to all phase / 2pi
values if \code{exact_phases} is FALSE (default). This makes them
irrational and opens otherwise closed Lissajous figures of betatron
oscillations in X-Y plane. If this is not desired, \code{exact_phases}
should be set to TRUE. Then all phases/2pi are used exactly as they are
given.}

\item{gaussian}{List with "x" and "y" components. Each component is in turn
a list with two elements, "sig" and "w" specifying Gaussian sig(mas) in
um and the corresponding w(eights) of the multi-Gaussian kicked bunch
density. All Gaussians should have a common mean at zero. The weights
might be given not normalized.}
}
\value{
List with all function arguments as list components. It contains
    full information on the kicked bunch required for the B*B
    simulation. The list can be fed to \code{\link{beam_beam}(kicked,
    kickers, sim, quiet)} simulation function.
}
\description{
Convenience function aggregating kicked bunch parameters into
    the "kicked" argument of the \code{\link{beam_beam}(kicked, kickers,
    sim, quiet)}" simulation function.
